\section{Conclusion}

The coupled fluid dynamics and neutron transport problem presented in this paper can contribute to a rigorous verification of multiphysics tools, such as GeN-Foam.
To that end, we consider that the numerical experiment has been successful in demonstrating that essential functions of GeN-Foam are working correctly regarding the solvers and capabilities of the program that have been covered by this test case, which was the primary objective of this work.
In addition, the presented problem has been incorporated as a regression test for GeN-Foam development by the authors, increasing the robustness of the SQA currently in place, which relies mainly on reproducing the results of reference test cases.

For future work, it would be desirable to increase the test coverage to include more parts of the program, such as: turbulence, delayed neutron precursors transport, equations of state, reactivity feedbacks and multi-group neutronics.
As part of an ongoing effort, these should be added one at a time in further developments of this work, with the aim of creating a test case that can exercise the entire code selectively or simultaneously.
