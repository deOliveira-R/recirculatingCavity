\begin{abstract}
Code verification is an important part of software development process that asserts code correctness.
In this work, analytical solutions are used in order to develop a simple multiphysics problem involving coupled fluid dynamics and neutron transport to be used for verification of GeN-Foam.
Results show that the analytical solutions are successfully recovered from numerical simulation, with relative errors of the order of less than 0.01\%.
We conclude that the fluid dynamics and neutron transport solvers of GeN-Foam are working correctly in regard to the limited functionality explored in this test case. Test coverage should be expanded to include additional models, such as turbulence, cross-section parametrization and delayed neutron precursors transport.
